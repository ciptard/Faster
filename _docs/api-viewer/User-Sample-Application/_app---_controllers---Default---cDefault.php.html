		<!-- ========== Info from phpDoc block ========= -->
<p class="short-description">This is the default controller for when nothing is added on the end of the URL.</p>
<p class="description"><p>Here you may use the $this object to access the request (synonym for &quot;controller&quot;), model, view,  core, and data objects and their class methods. Typically you would begin with getting values from  $this-&gt;request, then passing things into the models that you load with $this-&gt;model, and then set  vars with $this-&gt;view-&gt;setVar() or $this-&gt;view-&gt;setVars(), followed by optionally displaying that  content with $this-&gt;view-&gt;display(). Note if a file path is specified in display, it will use  that. Otherwise, it will assume almost the same path as the controller.</p><p>Note that controller files must be in a folder and must begin with the lowercase letter &quot;c&quot;. This  is for two reasons: (1) so we don't confuse them with a parameter, and (2) so when we have a text  editor open with multiple tabs, we can easily delineate our controllers files.</p><p>Note that models do not need a file prefix like &quot;c&quot;. These are not added there because most coders  will be &quot;living&quot; in the models area of a project, and therefore don't need to type this all the  time. Besides, controllers and views use a prefix.</p><p>Note that view files must be in a folder and must begin with the lowercase letter &quot;v&quot;. This helps  us delineate these files in a tabbed text editor so as not to be confused with other files.</p><p>So, somme sample urls could be mapped with routes like so:</p><p>http://example.com/this-is-my-article = application/controllers/Defalt/cDefault.php  http://example.com/articles/this-is-my-article = application/controllers/Articles/cDefault.php  http://example.com/my-tickets/add-one = application/controllers/MyTickets/cAddOne.php</p></p>
