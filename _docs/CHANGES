CHANGES
***********************************

1.0366
***********************************
- The 1.0365 had some problems. Fixed this bug regarding dispatchRoute(): 
  https://github.com/volomike/Faster/issues/19
- Adjusted getParams() with a problem on the Default controller. If nothing was passed in the URL,
  the getParams() was returning basically the equivalent of $this->core->base(). Now it returns
  the proper URL parameters.

1.0365
***********************************
- Fixed a bug in a 404 handler where it kept redirecting to the homepage on incorrectly pathed 
  controllers.

1.0364
***********************************
- Added trigesimal number range to getNewID(). If we use a size of 8 digits with a dash, and no 
  leading zeroes, that's around 21.8 billion numbers possible. That's (7 ^ 30) - 1000000. Previously
  this routine only generated 47 million unique numbers using the default size. Now it has a larger
  size and more parameters to take it even larger.

1.0363
***********************************
- Patched a very minor problem in the comments for getNewID() where the primary key should have been 
  a cluster of both id and group, not just id.

1.0362
***********************************
- Improved getNewID() so that it can work with a number larger than 7 digits separated by a dash. The
  7 digit system (which is partly hex) gives you roughly 47 million IDs, but we expanded this so that
  it can handle more.

1.0361
***********************************
- Fixed base URL path problem in getPath() and baseurl() functions. The problem would only appear on
  some hosts with strange configurations where DOCUMENT_ROOT was not normal.

1.036
***********************************
- Prevented a problem (not a bug -- it's a common user mistake) where someone creates hyperlinks with
  .php on the end, which bungles the routing. Edited the polishAction() class method in the 
  Faster_Request class to remove the ".php".

1.035
***********************************
- Changed config.php to add a database port and remove an unused MAIL_FROM parameter.
- Changed Faster_Data->getNewID() to include some sample SQL statements in the comments as an aid for
  that class method.

1.034
***********************************
- Fixed a case where MagicQuotes may be turned on at the server with some web hosting plans. This 
  impacted anywhere I using $_GET and $_POST.

1.033
*********************************** 
- Fixed MySQL connection string bug. Was a minor bug and the code still worked anyway.

1.032
*********************************** 
- Renamed site.php to config.php and changed all references of site.php to config.php. Made more
  sense, and one of the earlier forks of Faster (before it was named that) did this.
- Fixed bug in SQLite connection code where we failed to set exception mode. This fixes problems
  where we get meaningless non-object errors simply because SQL syntax is incorrect.
- Added a default 1 hour session timeout. This can be changed by the user by editing index.php near
  the top.
- Changed getPostedVars(), getVars(), getPostVar(), and getVar() so that they apply trim() and
  stripslashes(), and may also do urldecode() (in the case of $_GET). As well, it does strip_tags()
  by default but this can be set to FALSE -- it's a new parameter. Meanwhile, those who want an
  override (like raw), can go access $_POST and $_GET without the function wrapper.

1.031
*********************************** 
- Added HEADER and FOOTER constants as shortcuts to get to a preferred header or footer path in the
  views.
- Added getVar($sKey), getPostedVar($sKey), getParam($nIndex), and getServerVar($sKey) in 
  Faster_Request.

1.03
*********************************** 
- Noticed that all these cDefault.php and vDefault.php files would be very confusing. I fixed this
  by permitting an alternative way. So, if you have an /about page, then the folder would be "About"
  and the files could be cAbout.php for the controller, and vAbout.php for the view. This lets you
  know which file is which in a tabbed text editor without confusion. The system will first look for
  cDefault.php, and, not finding that, would look for cAbout.php, and the same thing for the view.

1.02
*********************************** 
- Added command line usage with the --path="" technique, as in --path="complex-path/more-complex". 
  Note that arguments can come after this with --parameters if you wish. The double dash is optional
  and is removed. Also, if the parameters are wrapped with double or single quotes, these are 
  removed. See the EXTRA doc in this folder for an explanation of usage.
- Because of the new CLI usage, added 2 new public class methods polishGroup() and polishAction() 
  which are used for switching the group and action parts of the CLI path or the URL path to the 
  proper format necessary for dispatchRoute().

1.01
*********************************** 
- Renamed the framework into "Faster".
- Refactored the Framework class in index.php. Removed the need to reinstantiate the framework, 
  which makes the framework load faster.
- Reworked the folder layout with the additional "app" folder so that there's not only better
  security, but better root folder organization in case someone wants other stuff in the root
  folder.
- Better docs (now that I understand phpdoc better).
- Chagned site.conf -> site.php for more security.
- Added a complex path example under the application controllers.
- Added output of Base Path and Base URL (very important things in a framework), as well as page
  loading time.


1.0 
***********************************
- Initial release, called "PHP Simple Generic MVC Framework"
