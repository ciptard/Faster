CHANGES
***********************************

1.01
*********************************** 
- Renamed the framework into "Faster".
- Refactored the Framework class in index.php. Removed the need to reinstantiate the framework, 
  which makes the framework load faster.
- Reworked the folder layout with the additional "app" folder so that there's not only better
  security, but better root folder organization in case someone wants other stuff in the root
  folder.
- Better docs (now that I understand phpdoc better).
- Chagned site.conf -> site.php for more security.
- Added a complex path example under the application controllers.
- Added output of Base Path and Base URL (very important things in a framework), as well as page
  loading time.


1.0 
***********************************
- Initial release, called "PHP Simple Generic MVC Framework"
